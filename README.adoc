=== Building

Clone the repo and type:

----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

=== Tests

Tests can be run against https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/[Minikube] or a full Kubernetes cluster such as https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/[GKE]. Tests will be run against the curent context in `kubectl`. The integration tests have a rule that will check to see if a Kubernetes instance can be reached, if so then it will run the integration tests.  If no Kubernetes instance can be reached then the integration tests will be skipped.

[NOTE]
If you get authentication errors, try setting basic auth credentials obtained from your target Kubernetes installation:

----
$ KUBERNETES_AUTH_BASIC_USERNAME=username KUBERNETES_AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD=password ./mvnw clean install
